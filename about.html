        <div class="about">
            <p>Greetings!</p>
            <p>I am a graduate student, currently on a journey towards a Master's in Information Technology and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech).</p>
            <p>My academic voyage began at the French graduate engineering school École supérieure d'électronique de l'Ouest (ESEO), where I acquired skills in software engineering. During this time, I ventured into the realm of Java programming and relational database management, embarking on numerous technical projects that challenged my problem-solving abilities. These experiences not only deepened my knowledge but also sparked my enthusiasm for software development.</p>
            <p>My professional journey led me to the dynamic world of software development as a junior Java developer at adesso SE, where I had the privilege of being part of the MIGSuite product team. In this role, I automated Docker container creation, ensuring efficiency in our integration testing process. My tasks also included managing SQL relational databases and contributing to the enhancement of the Angular frontend.</p>
            <p>Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I firmly believe in holistic personal growth. My active participation in various student clubs and organizations has been instrumental in refining my teamwork and project management skills. It has ingrained in me the importance of fostering strong team cohesion to achieve collective goals effectively.</p>
            <p><b>Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you.</b></p>
